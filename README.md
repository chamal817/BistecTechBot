**Code Crunch 2023 - Team A**

**Problem Description:**

Systems engineers set up and maintain organizations' software and enable user access. Network administrators install, configure, and manage computer infrastructure, such as routers, switches, firewalls and cables, that support an organization's computer networks. 

Even though an employee can inquire or raise questions through Microsoft teams chat, the possibility of solving a scenario or giving a solution can be short term or long term. There may be critical questions that affect an employee, which system administrator needs to quickly configure. The product facilitates predicting the priority level for each issue that an employee raises. 

**Solution:**

A Smart solution to manage system engineer’s workload with employee inquiries using an app based on prioritize on level related to employee inquiries and questions. 

**Innovativeness & Uniqueness of the product:**

An automated system that can be used by the system engineer without going through all the inquiries to check which inquiries need to prioritize first.
